# Totem

### NO LONGER ACTIVELY DEVELOPED

This was a fun project to extend learning, but it has served its time. Technically the code here is functional, albeit an incomplete feature set.

A self-hosted API that lets you roll your personal web analytics server. With Totem, you can track how many visits were made to your website, while owning site visit data and implementation.

### The Name and Intention
Totem poles are monumental carvings consisting of poles, posts or pillars, carved with symbols or figures. They're made with love and care, custom-built from the ground up. 

Totem is the most important piece of your web analytics - the part that collects, stores, and sends site visit data. It's created so that you can make it your own, so that you can be free to represent your data visually, in any way that you would like. 

I made it to be flexible with how I use my site visit data. I could analyze it with a script, display it in a CLI tool, a local web app, or even publish site visit metrics online.
