# Totem

A self-hosted API that lets you roll your personal web analytics server. With Totem, you can track how many visits were made to your website, while owning site visit data and implementation.

Currently in active development. Docs and demos coming soon.

### The Name and Intention
Totem poles are monumental carvings consisting of poles, posts or pillars, carved with symbols or figures. They're made with love and care, custom-built from the ground up. 

Totem is the most important piece of your web analytics - the part that collects, stores, and sends site visit data. It's created so that you can make it your own, so that you can be free to represent your data visually, in any way that you would like. 

I made it in mind to power a CLI app, or a local web app, or even to publish the website for one of my sites publicly.

### Built with Ruby
Ruby 3.0.0
Rails 6
